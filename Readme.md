# Transaction API

## Description

This repository contains a simple bank transaction API, developed in Go using the following technologies:

- **Gin**: Web framework
- **Viper**: Configuration management
- **sqlc**: SQL code generator
- **goose**: Database migrations

The application stores data in a PostgreSQL database and supports schema migration on startup if enabled in the configuration.

### Health Check Endpoint

A health check endpoint is available and can be used for probes:

`/health`


## Infrastructure Requirements

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Version 12

## Configuration

Configuration is managed using `spf13/viper`. Default values are specified in the `config/default.yaml` file. All configuration values can be overridden using environment variables prefixed with `BANK`.

**Example:** Override the PostgreSQL host:

```export BANK_POSTGRES_HOST=example.com:2019 ```

## Assessment Tasks

* Dockerfile: Prepare a Dockerfile to build and run this application.

* Docker Compose: Create a docker-compose.yml file for local testing. The application should start and be accessible.

* GitHub Actions: Set up a workflow to build the Docker image and push it back to the repository for both the main branch and tags.

* Helm Chart: Develop a Helm chart to deploy the application in Kubernetes. The application should:

    - Run in 5 replicas
    - Be deployed on nodes with the label role: api
    - Allocate only one pod per node
    
* CI for Unit Tests (Optional): Set up continuous integration for running unit tests. The command for executing tests is:
```go test -v -cover ./...```


# DevOps task Deployment Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the SimpleBank API using **Docker Compose** for local development and **Helm** for Kubernetes environments.

---

## üì¶ Option 1: Run with Docker Compose (Local Development)

This setup runs the API and PostgreSQL locally using Docker Compose.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start the Application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ram-vibhul/devops-assesment.git
cd devops-assesment

docker-compose up --build
```

### üñë Stop the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### üìç Access the Application

- **API URL:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Health Check:** `http://localhost:8080/health`

---

## Option 2: Deploy with Helm (Kubernetes)

Steps for deploying SimpleBank in a Kubernetes environment.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ram-vibhul/devops-assesment.git
   cd devops-assesment/
   ```

2. **Install the Helm Chart:**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install simplebank ./charts
   ```

3. **Check Deployment Status:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get svc
   ```

4. **(Optional) Port Forward to Access API Locally:**

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/simplebank-simplebank 8080:8080
   ```

##  Health Check

To verify the API is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
